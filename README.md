 
# App Setting Finder (diglett)

This application (early development) is intended to inspect all application code in order to map all app_settings.
The intention is to document all app_settings found and describe the purpose of each one of them.

This application is being developed using the GO Programming language (1.18).

### References

**REF001** - Create a menu with the following options:

```
1 - Setup
2 - Search for App Settings
3 - Compare App Settings
4 - Start web service
5 - Close application
```

- **Setup** - This option will allow the development to set the path of the App folder (where contains the php files). 
     - The value informed by the developer must be saved in a file placed in the config folder.

**Configuration file example**
```
APP_PATH=/home/user/PHPApp
```
- **Search for App Settings** - This option should trigger the search for app_settings.

- **Compare App Settings** - This option should trigger a comparison for app_settings. For more details read the reference *(REF006)*.

- **Start web service** - This option should launch the web app, allowing the developer to manipulate the app_settings that need manual handling. For more details read the reference *(REF010)*.

- **Close application** - Closes the application.

--- 

**REF002** - Write a routine that automatically searches for app_settings in the source code of the PHP application.\
This routine should consider all possible ways to use an app_setting, *for example*:
```
- AppSettingManager::get('app_setting.name')
- AppSetting::model()->findByAttributes(array('option' => 'app_setting.name'))
```
**Note:** *I believe we can read the file all at once rather than line by line, considering the files aren't that big*.

---

**REF003** - Generate a simple file to insert the app_settings that were successfully found.\
This file must be placed inside the output folder and must always be regenerated every time the application is executed.

---
**REF004** - Generate a simple file to insert the app_settings were found but needs manual checking.\
This file must be placed inside the output folder and must always be regenerated every time the application is executed.

---
**REF005** - Create a feature as simple as possible that allows the developer to add logs.\
This feature must provide at least four levels of logging (**Info**, **Debug**, **Warn** and **Error**).\
The log file must always be regenerated every time the application is executed.

---
**REF006** - This functionality should compare the output.txt file versus the input.csv file (for example).\
The result of this comparison should print which app_setting exists in the database and does not exist in the source code and vice versa.\
At the end of the comparison process, a report should be printed on the screen, informing the number of differences found.\
A file should also be saved inside the output folder, called comparison.txt where all the differences found will be add.

---
**REF007 / REF008** - Create a feature to categorize the app_setting during the analysis process. This feature should take into account the points below:

- Add a slice with keywords
- A new file named *output_categorized.xlsx* must be created inside the output folder. All categorized app_settings should be add in this file.
- The algorithm should check if the app_setting content contains any of the defined keywords, for example:
```
App setting = feauture.google.enable
```
In the case above, the algorithm should add the category = google.

- The second option refers to the file path. Files are often organized within the project folder.

- The third and last check refers to the file name, if the file name has a keyword, then that category can be used.

**Note**: If we found a keyword in the first check, then the other checks can be disregarded.

---

**REF009** - Analyze best database solution. Maybe sqlite?.
```
Remembering that we don't want to install any database solution, the ideal would be to not even consider a container for that.
```

- A basic table structure should be created. The App_setting found must be added to this table allowing the user to be able to handle it later through the web interface.

---
**REF010** - This reference will be described later because it is something more complex.

---
**REF011** - This reference is related to REF010. A more suitable folder structure should be considered allowing us to build two different applications.

---
**REF012** - Builds must provide executables compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
